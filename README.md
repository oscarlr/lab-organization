## Naming samples and experiments
It is common to generate multiple datasets for the same sample. These rules should be following in naming the sample and experiment.
```
1. Sample names should be the most common used name. 
2. Experiment names should be unique. They should contain the sample name, project identifier and short description.
3. A datapath should be attached to a name and experiment.
```
The end result should be a table with all three entries. For example:
```
sample  experiment  datapath
NA19240 NA19240-1KGP_redo_1  /data/NA19240.fastq
```
